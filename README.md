# Drone Attitude Estimation using IMU Sensors

Konkuk University, Fundamentals of Signals and Systems (Spring 2025) Term Project.
This project focuses on estimating the roll and pitch angles of a drone using 3D motion signal processing techniques with data from an IMU (Accelerometer and Gyroscope).

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to implement and compare various sensor fusion algorithms to determine the drone's attitude (roll/pitch). The implemented methods include:
- Attitude estimation using only accelerometer data.
- Attitude estimation using only gyroscope data (via Euler kinematics).
- Sensor fusion using a Complementary Filter.
- (Optional) Sensor fusion using a Kalman Filter.

## Files

- `packet_student.m`: A script to load the `signal_exp_data.bag` ROS bag file, extract relevant topics (IMU, OptiTrack), and save them into a `packet_data.mat` file for easier processing.
- `ARS_student_V1.m`: The main script for implementing the attitude determination algorithms. It performs bias removal, filtering, and sensor fusion.
- `data/packet_data.mat`: The processed data file generated by `packet_student.m`.

## How to Run

1.  **Data Preparation**:
    *   Place the `signal_exp_data.bag` file in the same directory.
    *   Run `packet_student.m` in MATLAB to generate `packet_data.mat`.

2.  **Attitude Estimation**:
    *   Run `ARS_student_V1.m`.
    *   The script will generate plots comparing the results from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and complementary filter against the reference data from the OptiTrack system.

## Key Implementation Details

-   **Gyroscope Bias Removal**: The initial stationary period of the data is used to calculate and remove the gyroscope bias.
-   **Noise Filtering**: A Low-Pass Filter (LPF) is applied to both accelerometer and OptiTrack data to reduce noise from vibrations.
-   **Complementary Filter**: Fuses the low-frequency accuracy of the accelerometer with the high-frequency accuracy of the gyroscope. The fusion weight `alpha` is tuned for optimal performance (best results found around `alpha = 0.98`).
